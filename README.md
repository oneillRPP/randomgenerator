# Random Generator

This is my Random Generator project. It takes as input a seed of numbers and their associated probabilities, and implements a method nextNum().

### Running the project

The project can be run manually from within an IDE. Simply navigate to src/main/kotlin/io.ytree.randomgenerator/App.kt and run the main() method.

The project can also be run using gradle. From the root of the repo, simply run:

```
./gradlew run
```
